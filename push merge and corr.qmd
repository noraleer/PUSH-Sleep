descriptive stats on both data tests pivot longer on wide and merge them

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
push_wide <- read_csv("PUSH_actigraph_geo_wide_8.7.25.csv")
push_long <- read_csv("PUSH_long_geo.csv")
```

## Wide Descriptive Stats

```{r}
# amount of actigraph days that are completed
unique(push_wide$C_ACTI_Interval)

parts <- push_wide %>% select(ParticipantID, C1_ACTI_SL_Interval) 
parts
```

## Long Descriptive Stats

```{r}
# amount of antiactical days that are completed
unique(push_long$C_ACTI_Interval)

unique(push_long$C_ACTI_Yes) #only 1s, so all actigraph are completed

push_long$C_DD_Yes # 0 and 1; 0 is no daily diary


id <- unique(push_long$ParticipantID)
length(id)
```

### left join

```{r}
# Perform a left join
all <- left_join(push_long, push_wide, by = "ParticipantID")
write.csv(all, file = "push_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
